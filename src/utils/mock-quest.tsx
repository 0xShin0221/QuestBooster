The Lens Protocol is a Web3 social graph on the Polygon Proof-of-Stake blockchain. It is designed to empower creators to own the links between themselves and their community, forming a fully composable, user-owned social graph. For this Quest, we will be completing tasks on Lenster, an application built on top of the Lens Protocol.

As an added bonus for quality content, we’ve got a special prize for the top collected post.

Let’s get you onboarded to the Lens ecosystem!
